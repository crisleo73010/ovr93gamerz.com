<body><h1><b>Hello, OVR here. My real name is Rudrangsho Haldar. I am from India. I an a school student.
Right now I am in the 8th standard. Now i will tell you that how this channel came up to my mind.<b></h1><br>
I was fond of playing games from 3rd standard. I used to play Temple run all day long. Last year one of my friend created a Youtube channel. So he also told me that I can also make a Youtube channel.<br>
Then I thought that wait, thats a good idea! Then within a couple of days, I made my Youtube channel. I named it 93OVRGAMER. I named it like that because I had a team in fifa mobile which was of 93 OVR.<br>
In the first day, I made a video of myself playing Fifa mobile. I got ony 1 like on that video then. Then after making some mnore videos, I found out that on one liked the video and not subscribed too.<br>
I had 23 videos and 5 subs then. I was having a hard time. I also told one of my friend who have a channel in youtube. His name is Xcatra Tech a.k.a Abhirup. He is my school friend.<br>
 I told him that I am thinking of quiting youtube. He said that to never loose hope on yourself. These words gave me a bit faith. Then everything was fine. Then I saw my channel slowly growing.<br>
Many people hated my channel too. but I remembered my Friend's words"never loose hope". Then one day in this year, arround the month May, I uploaded a video at night. Then in the morning I opened my phone and saw that the video have hit 900 views<br>
I was shocked to see that. I felt very happy and soon I hit 50 subs. Then I continued posting videos but one day I poseted a short video of Ronaldo. That video was growing very fast. In 5 minutes it hir 500 views and within one day it hit 11k views!<br>
then this video made my channel grow a lot. in 6 days my channel hit 104 subs! I want to thank all of my subscribers and my friends who supported my channel. Thank you very much guys<br>
